#--> Project M.Y.S.T.E.R.I.O.  #

## Project Mysterio : May Your Surveillence Time End - Reconfigure , Invent , Outmaneuver ##

    -- An anti-surveillence program which will try to remove the human-type of vulnerability on the internet.

    -- A human is the most vulnerable part of any organization as they are the most easy to exploit via social engineering.

    -- This project aims at releiving some stress as well helping some unsuspecting people from getting themselves hacked.

    -- This project also aims at providing anonimity while on the internet. 


## -- This project will have atleast 9 modules : ##


    -- 0- Anti-Catphish : This module will check if the individual has been catphished / If there some fake account of the individual out on the internet

    -- 1- Anti-Phishing : This module will check if a given website / email is a phishing email. This will also generate a detailed report of the website to be submiited to authorities in case of a phishing website 

    -- 2- VPN + TOR     : This module will route all of the internet traffic of the device via a VPN which will then be routed via the TOR protocol

    -- 3- Noisy         : This module will be some sort of an advanced version of the 'Noisy' script written by 1tayH in 'https://github.com/1tayH/noisy'. Nosiy will generate random traffic noise so that one can go about regular web browsing while not worrying about their data getting picked up. Due to the noise, the data you will generate will be relatively less valuable

    -- 4- Video Spoofing: This module will ensure that any sort of background video recording will always be some random noise. If any service is secretly recoding under one's nose, that will only record some random noise which will have no trace of the user.

    -- 5- Audio Spoofing: This module will ensure that any sort of background audio/voice recording will always be some random noise. If any service is secretly recoding under one's nose, that will only record some random noise which will have no trace of the user.

    -- 6- GPS Spoofing  : This module will ensure that any kind of GPS data will be completely random.

    -- 7- MAC Spoofing  : This module will ensure that the device's MAC address is spoofed.

    -- 8- BackDoor Check: This module will do extensive/light scans on the device to check for any backdoors on the device.

    -- x -Extreme Conditions Kit : This kit will be the End Game scenario for ensuring anonimity of a user. The minute details like mouse movement which is actually analzyed by the NoCaptcha ReCaptcha will be manipulated. Another service in this kit would be manipulating the keystrokes (typing patterns/conventions), delay between keystrokes, etc. Even a pipl like massive search for the user's digital footprint.

## 
-- Modules like Anti-catphish & Anti-phishing will relieve some factor of the human vulnerability. Meanwhile other modules can be used to anonimize an individual.
##

##-- Modules to be added can be : ##

    -- 1- Call Protect : If someone asks for sensitive information on a phone call, the receiver of the call will be notified and caller of the phone call will be reported ( could consider conformation from the the receiver)

    -- ... ( any other possible modules which can be added)


##  These are extreme level cases :   ##

    ##--> Manipulating your typing / keystrokes ( so that not they can't track you via your typing patterns ) ##

    ##--> Manipulating the way you use the mouse ( same reason )  ##

    ##--> Manipulating the networks your device connects to  ##

    ##--> Manipulate your digital footprint ( Needs written conformation with signature or logo )  ##
